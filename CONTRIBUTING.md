## How do I contribute to QuantumACES.jl?

If you find a bug, or if you have a question or feature suggestion, create an issue!

Better yet, if you've written some code to fix a bug or add a feature, create a pull request!
However, I would advise that you discuss substantial code changes in an issue before writing them and creating a pull request.

Make sure to format code changes with JuliaFormatter and the supplied .JuliaFormatter.toml file, and please try to ensure that the suggestions match the style used throughout the package!
